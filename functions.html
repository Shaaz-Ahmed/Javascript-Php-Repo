<!-- Functio is a piece of code. which is used when you have to perform a specific task repititvely.
A javascript function is declared by function keyword and followed by parameter
A code inside the function is executed when something invoke (call) it.
When js reaches to return statement it will stop executing.
without calling the function it is of no use so for calling the function we just have to write the function name -->
