<!-- Variable is used to store something there are three ways in js to declare the Variable
1) let 
2) const 
3) var 
basically the purpose of these 3 are same but constant value cannot change throught program 
whreas the main difference between let & var is that we cannot re-declare the variable whrease using var we can re-declare 
The best practice is used let while declaring the variable  -->
